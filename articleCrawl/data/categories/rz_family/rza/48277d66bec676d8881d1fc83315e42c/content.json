According to Table 47.2 DC Characteristics (8) in the User's Manual, the maximum current flow to the DP and DM pins is approximately 21.7 mA, based on the output high level voltage max = 440 mV and the termination resistance of 45 Ω ± 10% (40.5 Ω to 49.5 Ω). If RZ/A1L is used in accordance with USB2.0 specifications, there is no need for the customer to consider the permissible output current values.\n*The above explanation is for RZ/A1L, but the same applies to other applicable products.\nSuitable Products\nRZ/A1 Group, \nRZ/A2M"
