In this case, recovery into Linux takes place rapidly because the data on the DDR is stored. \nThe time for the Linux Kernel to start up after the recovery trigger is about 0.1 sec. The initialization time of the Linux Kernel differs depending on the settings of the kernel, but it is about 0.3 sec. when the settings are minimal. The recovery time needs to be verified with the actual system because it is dependent on the system configuration.\nSuitable Products\nRZ/G3S"
