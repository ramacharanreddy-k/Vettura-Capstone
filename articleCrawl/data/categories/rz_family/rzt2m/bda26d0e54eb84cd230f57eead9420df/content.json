The below log is an example produced by the lsusb utility. The bConfigurationValue is 3 in this example.\nStep2: Choose the CDC Communication (2: USB_CLASS_COMMUNICATIONS) and Data (10: USB_CLASS_CDC_DATA) interfaces (by bInterfaceNumber and bAlternateSetting) contained the endpoints for the transaction of BULK-IN/OUT and INTR-IN. The below log is an example produced by lsusb utility. In this case, the bInterfaceNumber & bAlternateSetting are 0 & 0 and 1 & 1 for CDC Comm. and Data interfaces respectively.\nStep3: Set no packet filter (0x43: SET_ETHERNET_PACKET_FILTER) to 0x1F.\nThe filter values are as the following\nUSB_CDC_PACKET_TYPE_PROMISCUOUS          0x01\nUSB_CDC_PACKET_TYPE_ALL_MULTICAST       0x02\nUSB_CDC_PACKET_TYPE_DIRECTED                  0x04\nUSB_CDC_PACKET_TYPE_BROADCAST               0x08\nUSB_CDC_PACKET_TYPE_MULTICAST               0x10\nStep4: Get the notification of network connection and disconnection through CDC Communication Interface (INTR-IN EP).\nUSB_CDC_NETWORK_CONNECT packet\n{\n0xA1, /* bmRequestType */\n0x00, /* bRequest */\n0x01, /* wValue (lo) */\n0x00, /* wValue (hi) */\n0x01, /* wIndex (lo) */\n0x00, /* wIndex (hi) */\n0x00, /* wLength (lo) */\n0x00 /* wLength (hi) */\n}\nUSB_CDC_NETWORK_DISCONNECT packet\n{\n0xA1, /* bmRequestType */\n0x00, /* bRequest */\n0x00, /* wValue (lo) */\n0x00, /* wValue (hi) */\n0x01, /* wIndex (lo) */\n0x00, /* wIndex (hi) */\n0x00, /* wLength (lo) */\n0x00 /* wLength (hi) */\n}\nStep5: Transmit and receive ethernet packets through CDC Data Interface (BULK-IN/OUT EPs).\nBesides the above steps, there are several more points to be checked. The 1st one is to allocate USB buffer in non-cache area and the 2nd one is to check USB device enumeration process. Will it just use configuration 0 as default? Or it will check available configurations and choose the proper one. The last one is to make sure with different buffer location for INTR-IN and BULK-IN/OUT EPs. Finally, there are two CDC-ECM dongles (RTL8153 and AX88179A) with verified functionalities on T2M-RSK with FreeRTOS+TCP stack.\nSuitable Products\nRZ/T2M"
