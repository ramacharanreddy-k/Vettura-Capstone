However, the full part number includes a ROM code made of 3 digits (one letter and two numbers) which identify the application software programmed in the device at factory. So, for example, for a specific application, the full part number of the product might be R9A06G150D01GNH where D01 identifies the ROM (application firmware) code. The ROM code is defined according to the specific Voice HMI application and functionality implemented.
