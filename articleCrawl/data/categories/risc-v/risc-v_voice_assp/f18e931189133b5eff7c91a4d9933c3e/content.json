Besides from the device part number (reflecting the full device part name, including the ROM code identifying the pre-programmed firmware) there is a unique identifier programmed in the chip which is 128-bit wide. Both the unique code and part number can be queried over the device programming interface.\nSuitable Products\nRISC-V Voice ASSP"
