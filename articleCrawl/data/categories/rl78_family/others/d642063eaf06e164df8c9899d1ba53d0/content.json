However, the emulator that previously operated no longer starts on this lower power supply voltage. Both the target and the emulator have been operating without problems.\nAnswer:\nThe possible cause is that the reset of the RL78 is not released because the LVD voltage set by the option bytes of the RL78 mounted on the target is higher than the new voltage.\n\nStart the emulator with the higher power supply voltage that was previously used. Then, write settings in which the option byte has been changed to the \"LVD off\" setting or in which the detection voltage has been changed to lower than the new power supply voltage you want to use.\n(Alternatively, you can erase the flash by using a flash programmer.)\nSuitable Products\nRL78 Family\nE2 Emulator [RTE0T00020KCE00000R] \nE2 Emulator Lite [RTE0T0002LKCE00000R] \nE1 [R0E000010KCE00] Discontinued product\nGo to Japanese"
