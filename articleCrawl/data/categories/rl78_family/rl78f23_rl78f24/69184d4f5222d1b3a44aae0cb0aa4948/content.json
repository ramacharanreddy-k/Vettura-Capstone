As a security function, it supports AES-128/192/256 and is functionally equivalent to Evita-light. In terms of functional safety, it is equivalent to ASIL-B. It has dedicated hardware to support BLDC motor control. For F24, it supports CAN FD. Other functions have compatibility with F13, F14. They are fully pin compatible to F13 and F14 to make it easy for transition to F23, F24.\nSuitable Products\nRL78/F23, RL78/F24"
