In addition, it has a number of environmental sensors for indoor, outdoor, temperature, and humidity, as well as inertial, barometric, SpO2, and Mems microphones ideal for evaluating IoT devices. The provided software enables end-to-end secure connection to Amazon's AWS Cloud and Microsoft's Azure Cloud. This makes it ideal for prototype development and evaluation of IoT devices with sensor functions. These software products consist of RA's FSP and RX's FIT platform. By leveraging these ecosystems, development of IoT devices can be done easily.\nSuitable Products\nRA6M5,\nRX65N/RX651"
