The Δ-ΣA/D converters of the RX23E-B have the high speed performance and noise performance enhanced from those of the RX23E-A. The Δ-ΣA/D converters of the RX23E-B support a maximum of 125 kSPS, which is eight times faster than that of the RX23E-A.. The RMS noise performance is also reduced from that of the RX23E-A to about a 1/3. Other differences are that a 16-bit D/A converter and +/-10 V analog input are newly incorporated from the RX23E-B.\nAlso refer to the table below for details.\nSuitable Products\nRX23E-B"
