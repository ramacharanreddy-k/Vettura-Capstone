What are the possible causes?\nAnswer:\nThe reason why the count value decreases while being touched is that the electrode capacitance is changing due to physical changes in the electrodes and the surroundings of the electrodes. For example, a change in capacitance to an electrode due to expansion and contraction due to temperature change.\nSuitable Products\nRX113\nRX130\nRX231, RX230"
