        "content": "Question:\nWhy is the mutual capacity method more water resistant?\nAnswer:\nIn the mutual capacitance method, the decrease in capacitance between electrodes is detected when a finger touches the panel, and it is judged to have been touched. If water drops adhere to the panel, the inter-electrode capacitance increases. Therefore, the water resistance is high because the change in water droplets and the change in touch can be distinguished.\nSuitable Products\nRX113\nRX130\nRX231, RX230"
