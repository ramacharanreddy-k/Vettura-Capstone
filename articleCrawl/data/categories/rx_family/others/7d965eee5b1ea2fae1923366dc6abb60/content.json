At this time, a link error occurred. Why?\nAnswer:\nThis is probably due to RAM space being insufficient to allocate window data. \nIf an RX65N is used, the RAM space available is separated into two areas, Internal RAM (256 KB) and Extended Internal RAM (384 KB), and the addresses in these areas are not consecutive. \nAlso, in use cases where windows are displayed on an LCD, a large amount of space is consumed for frame buffers. Therefore, in these cases, it is very important to manage RAM usage and section allocation. By specifying the section settings so that Extended Internal RAM is used, you become able to fully use the space of both the Internal RAM (256 KB) and Extended Internal RAM (384 KB) areas.\nSuitable Products\nRX Family\n  日本語"
