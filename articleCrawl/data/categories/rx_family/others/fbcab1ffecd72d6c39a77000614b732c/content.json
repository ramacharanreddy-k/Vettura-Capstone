Adjust the colors in an optimal way by using adjustments such as brightness, contrast, and gamma compensation, as well as the rounding to the nearest even number (setting 0 for non-effective bits lower than effective bits) or 2x2 pattern dithering.\nFor details, see the chapter on the graphic LCD controller (GLCDC) in the hardware user's manual for the RX72N, RX65N, or RX651 group equipped with GLCDC.\nSuitable Products\nRX Family\n日本語"
