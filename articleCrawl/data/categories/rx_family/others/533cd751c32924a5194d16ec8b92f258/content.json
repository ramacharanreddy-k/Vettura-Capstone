For a USB host:\nBecause the USB output waveform must satisfy a precision of ±500 ppm, it is recommended that you use the source clock at a precision of ±100 ppm.\n2. For a USB function:\nBecause the USB output waveform must satisfy a precision of ±2500 ppm, it is recommended that you use the source clock at a precision of 500 ppm.\n  Suitable Products\nRX"
