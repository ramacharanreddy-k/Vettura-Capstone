In this case, if a voltage of 5 V DC is supplied to VBUS from a device via the USB connector, isn't the pin (PC16 or PC4) to which USB0_VBUS is connected damaged?\nAnswer:\nThe PC16 is 5-volt tolerant even when power is off. Therefore, no problem occurs when VBUS is directly connected.\nBecause the PC4 is not 5-volt tolerant, lower the voltage to 3.3 V by using, for example, a resistive voltage divider.\nSuitable Products\nRX113"
