The user must specify the first address of free space in the Internal RAM or Extended Internal RAM area.\nTherefore, the size of frame buffers is not included in the buffer size set with [Work area size for GUI] (size of the buffer used by emWin). Also, frame buffers are not included in section B, section R, and heap area. Note that frame buffers are just free space from the viewpoint of compiler, and therefore their sizes are not applied to the Memory Usage view and other components of e2 studio.\nIf you use QE for Display, you can set frame buffers in the following location.\nemWin FIT Module Settings:\nNote: The address of frame buffer 1 is linked to the setting of the start address of the frame buffer in the GLCDC FIT module.
