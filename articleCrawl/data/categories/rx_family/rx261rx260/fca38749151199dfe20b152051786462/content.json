On the other hand, the active current is kept to 69 µA/MHz, and the standby current to 1 µA.\nSnooze mode: Power consumption during intermittent operation can be minimized by using snooze mode to operate some of the peripheral functions in software standby.\nAdvanced touch functions: A third generation capacitive touch sensing unit (CTSU2SL) is incorporated, which offers improved noise immunity, water resistance, and low power consumption functions compared with the previous generation CTSU.\nRobust security IP: Only RX261 includes security IP (RSIP-E11A) with built-in encryption engines and an access management circuit that prevents unauthorized use of the encryption engines, as well as a key management function that prevents data leaking to the outside by making the key valid only within the security IP.\nProgram protection: An area protection function that enables setting non-rewritable areas in flash memory is included, making it suitable for storing a secure boot firmware.\nHigh speed, highly reliable communication functions: The RX261 only is equipped with USB full speed (host/function) and CAN FD, so the communication functions are enhanced.\nRX261: https://www.renesas.com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/rx-32-bit-performance-efficiency-mcus/rx261-microcontrollers-outstanding-power-efficiency-advanced-touch-functions-and-robust-security\nRX260: https://www.renesas.com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/rx-32-bit-performance-efficiency-mcus/rx260-microcontrollers-outstanding-power-efficiency-and-advanced-touch-functions\nSuitable Products\nRX261, RX260"
