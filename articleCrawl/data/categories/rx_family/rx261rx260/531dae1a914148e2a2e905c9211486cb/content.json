Furthermore, the active shield function improves water resistance by reducing the amount of change in capacitance caused by water getting on touch electrodes. In addition, by using the automatic judgement function and MEC (Multiple Electrode Connection) function, it is possible to reduce power consumption in applications that require intermittent operation.\nThese features allow the RX261 and RX260 to support a wider range of applications and operating environments compared with previous products.\nSuitable Products\nRX261, RX260"
