Just connecting with a PC for debugging by USB cable allows you to start application development because this product is equipped with an emulator circuit.\nRenesas Starter Kit for RX660:\nThis has a 144-pin package (with JTAG and SubOSC function support) mounted, and allows all functions of the RX660 to be evaluated. Since the board has various communication connectors and other components mounted, and is also equipped with a Pmod connector, you can connect a Wi-Fi module, sensor module, and other modules easily and speedily implement the evaluation of cloud connections and the PoC of IoT devices. \nSuitable Products\nRX660"
