This enables reuse and utilization of conventional 5V power supply system components. This product has enhanced functionality and improved usability compared to existing products, such as the RX24T, while maintaining a high degree of compatibility for built-in functions such as inverter control timers and pin layout orientation.\nDifferences between each product are summarized in the application notes below, which include a comparison of built-in functions, an overview of specifications, terminal functionality, and considerations for migration.\nDifferences between RX26T and RX66T groups \nDifferences between RX26T and RX24T/RX24U groups\nDifferences between RX26T and RX62T groups\nDifferences between RX26T and RX63T groups\nDifferences between RX26T and RX23T groups\nOther related information: Tips on Replacing MCUs of Other Families with RX MCUs\n  Suitable Products\nRX26T"
