If the CAN bus transceiver is not connected (e.g., the state when the receive pin is open), the MCU may not output a CAN transmit signal. Please check the setup of evaluation board used.\nSome RA Family evaluation kits (e.g., the EK-RA6M5) already mounted a CAN bus transceiver on the board, so users can start evaluation without additional components consideration.\nNote: Few development kits are shipped with cutting the line between MCU pins and the CAN bus transceiver by a solder jumper.
