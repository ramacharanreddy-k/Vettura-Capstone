Phoneme-based modeling. Quick command customization: no advance speech data collection. Optimization by model adaptation just with small amount speech data. Global language support: 44+ languages worldwide.\nVoice Activity Detection : Most IoT end-point applications are power constrained and speech recognition/ wake-word systems need to operate in always-on mode so our solution feature reduces power consumption further by up to 30%\nVoice Audio Playback : Enables voice response function on RA --> Input by Voice or TTS --> Compression to reduce file size --> Decompression and playback on RA.\nSuitable Products\nMCU : RA4E1 or RA6E1\nLDO : RAA214220\nOp-Amp : READ2302G\nQSPI : AT25SF641B"
