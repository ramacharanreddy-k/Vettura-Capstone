RA2E3 is cut down version of RA2E1 and we reduced ROM size from 128KB(max) to 64KB(Max), DATA flash size from 4KB to  2KB. Also we removed the functions of comparator, CTSU2, AES, and TRNG. Register configuration and pin assignment between RA2E1 and RA2E3 are identical except ACMP, CTSU2, AES and TRNG. Electrical characteristics are also same between RA2E1 and RA2E3.\nSuitable Products\nRA2E3"
