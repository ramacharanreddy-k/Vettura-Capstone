This low pin count interface is based on the MIPI D-PHY Specification Version 2.1, defined by the MIPI Alliance and supports connection to  MIPI compliant displays. The RA8D1 supports 2-lane MIPI-DSI, with each lane running up to 720Mbps. Internal 2MB flash and interface to external flash are also available for storage of graphics assets. \nSuitable Products\nRA8D1"
