On reset, the secure boot process starts in immutable memory and the FSBL authenticates the firmware image for the next stage (which could be the Renesas second stage bootloader or the customer's own bootloader) and code execution starts only when the the image has been authenticated and the integrity has been verified. The Renesas secure boot solution provides the flexibility to either do a full authentication with HMAC-SHA256, use a simpler CRC validation or completely bypass this secure boot.\nSuitable Products\nRA8M1, RA8D1, RA8T1"
