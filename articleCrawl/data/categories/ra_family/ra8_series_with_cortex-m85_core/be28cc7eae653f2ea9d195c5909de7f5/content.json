The new Arm CM85 core, with the Arm v8.1m architecture and a 7-stage superscalar pipeline, is the highest performance Cortex-M core in the industry and introduces Helium, the M-Profile Vector Extension (MVE) that enables an unprecedented 4x acceleration in DSP and AI/ML tasks vs. the older Cortex-M7 core. \nWith their high performance enabled by the Arm Cortex-M85 core and Helium, the new RA8 MCU devices bridge the gap between MCUs and MPUs and enable complex and compute intensive applications without having to switch to an MPU, all while providing the lower power consumption and ease of use of an MCU.\nSuitable Products\nRA8M1, RA8D1, RA8T1, RA8E1, RA8E2"
