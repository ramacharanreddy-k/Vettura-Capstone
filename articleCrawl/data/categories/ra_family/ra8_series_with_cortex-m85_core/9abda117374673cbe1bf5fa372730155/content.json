Depending on the use case, frame rates can be traded off against resolution and color depth. To support LCD panels of various resolution, the RA8E2 devices include multiple memory options for storage of graphics frame buffers, including internal 672KB SRAM and a high throughput 16bit SDRAM interface.\nSuitable Products\nRA8E2"
