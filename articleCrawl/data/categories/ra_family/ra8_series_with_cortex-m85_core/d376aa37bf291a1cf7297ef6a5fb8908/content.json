With the new Cortex-M85 core, Arm brings TrustZone to their highest performance cores, that enables isolation and secure/non-secure partitioning of memory, peripherals and code. The RA8 Series MCUs introduce the most advanced Renesas Security IP (RSIP-E51A) that provides leading edge cryptographic accelerators and supports a true secure boot. Other advanced security features include immutable storage for a strong hardware Root-of-Trust, Octal SPI with Decryption-on-the-fly (DOTF), secure authenticated debug, secure factory programming and tamper protection. In concert with Arm TrustZone, this enables comprehensive and fully integrated secure element functionality. The Arm v8.1-M architecture introduces Pointer Authentication and Branch Target Identification (PACBTI) security extension that provides mitigation for software attacks. The RA8 Series targets PSA Level 2+SE, NIST CAVP and FIPS 140-3 certifications.\nRA8D1:\nIn addition to leading performance, RA8 Series MCUs offer advanced, leading-edge security.
