Depending on the use case, frame rates can be traded off against resolution and color depth. To support low and high resolution displays, the RA8D1 devices include multiple memory options for storage of graphics frame buffers, including internal 1MB SRAM and a high throughput 32bit SDRAM interface.\nSuitable Products\nRA8D1"
