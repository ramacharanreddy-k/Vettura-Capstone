The DOTF feature enables secure storage of application code or data on external Octal memory and an encrypted code image stored in the external flash can be brought in securely via the OSPI interface. The primary advantage of using DOTF is that code execution and data read of the external memory is performed at full speed with seamless, background decryption. \nSuitable Products\nRA8M1, RA8D1"
