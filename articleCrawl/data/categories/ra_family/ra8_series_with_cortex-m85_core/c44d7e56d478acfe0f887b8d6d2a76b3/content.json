A combination of built-in DCDC converter, low power modes, independent power domains, lower operating voltage range, fast wakeup time and low typical active and standby currents enables lower overall system power and allows customers to meet regulatory requirements. The new Arm Cortex-M85 core also reduces power consumption for DSP/ML tasks.\nSuitable Products\nRA8M1, RA8D1, RA8T1, RA8E1, RA8E2"
