Two Code Flash are controlled at the same time. (64-bit I/O).\n2) RV40 Phase 2 .\nIn terms of register control and usage, MF4 is the same as MF3. So we currently have RV40F (proprietary) which is excellent for high flash density devices. MF3 / MF4 is excellent for low leakage / very low power consumption applications.\nMore information on Block configuration and similar topics is available here: https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/apn/flash-memory-programming\n  Suitable Products\nRA"
