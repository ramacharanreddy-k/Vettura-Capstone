Here are some examples.\nEmbedded MCU: RA4E1 is optimized mixture of high performance with 100 MHz Cortex-M33 Core in combination with lowest active power consumption. RA6M3 is built on a highly efficient 40nm process.\nKit: Supports smart low power mode (snooze mode activation by AMIC), Selectable connectivity through PMOD connectors allows to reduce power consumption, and Platform approach enables common base board for all AIK variants reducing the manufacturing carbon footprint.\nKit Box: are made using renewable cardboard, seals are biodegradable, card board inserts are used inside the box to reduce the amount of plastic bubble wrap and cushioning material.\nSuitable Products\nAIK-RA6M3\nAIK-RA4E1"
