That results in a verification error on RFP because different memory area is read from the MCU during the memory verification. If you want to change the AWS.BTFLG setting in a new program image, it is advised to write the value to AWS register first in the option setting memory, and then write a new program.\nSuitable Products\nRA and FSP"
