Normally when starting a debug connection, the debugger performs MCU reset. Immediately after MCU reset, MMF is disabled (MMEN.EN = 0). Therefore, do not set breakpoints in the memory mirror space until this bit is enabled by the user application or the debugger. Set a breakpoint in the space after MMF is enabled.\nSuitable Products\nRA and FSP"
