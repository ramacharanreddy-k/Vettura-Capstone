Let’s say, an interrupt INT0 has highest interrupt priority and INT1 has a lower priority than INT0. When the INT0 request occurs during the interrupt processing for INT1 has already started and been in the stack push, INT0 is served first instead of INT1 without another stack push. Thanks to this behavior, late-arriving interrupt (INT0) is handled slightly faster than normal.
