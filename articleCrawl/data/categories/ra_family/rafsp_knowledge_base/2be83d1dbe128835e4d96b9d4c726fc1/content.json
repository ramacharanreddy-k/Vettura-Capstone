Typically .elf file are used for debugging whereas .srec/.bin files are sent to the flash programmer for downloading to MCUs.  The advantage of using .bin over .srec file is that .bin files are  smaller, and can be further manipulated (calculating checksum, inserting additional information) before being downloaded.  Unlike an .srec file, address information is not included in a .bin file.  Instead, the .bin image is programmed continuously from a start location (typically 0x00000000) to the last location as specified in the linker script. The last location could be an option setting area. E.g., for RA6M4, code flash 0x00000000-0x000FFFFF while the option settings occupied 0x0100A100~0x0100A2FF.\n    Potentially a .bin file for RA6M4 could be 16,818,944 bytes (0x0~0x100A2FF)! Note this area includes two reserved areas where access is prohibited and the on-chip flash (factory flash) area.  If these areas are programmed, the chip could be damaged!\nIf a “.bin” file must be used, please check the target location and the size of the file generated.  If necessary, please omit the option setting area.
