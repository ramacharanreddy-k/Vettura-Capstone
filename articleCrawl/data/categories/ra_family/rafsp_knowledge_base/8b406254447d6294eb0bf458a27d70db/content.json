It is both MCU and board specific. The BSPs for the Renesas RA Evaluation kits are included in FSP packs, but users must create new BSPs for implementing their final products.\nFSP is CMSIS-compliant and is based on the CMSIS-core. Therefore, the board pack file structure is organized into folders containing the MCU and board specific CMSIS information and is represented as an XML-based pack description (PDSC) file as defined in the CMSIS standard (Keil, 2016). All these files are packed in a ZIP format (.zip).\nBSP Contents in FSP\nThe contents of the BSP are as follows:"
