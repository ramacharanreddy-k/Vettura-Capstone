In order to prevent unintentional counting operations, initialization processing in software is required even when the RTC is not used. If the Subclock Populated parameter is set to Populated in the BSP tab properties of the FSP Configurator, the R_BSP_Init_RTC function executes the RTC software reset process using the subclock oscillator as the clock source and waits for the process to complete.
