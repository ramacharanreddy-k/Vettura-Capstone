Should the code size exceed the size of on-chip memory, users have the option of using external flash connected to the Quad SPI interface, and executing the code directly from external flash. They also have the option of bringing the code into internal flash or SRAM and executing from internal memory.\nSuitable Products\nRA4L1"
