It allows customers to integrate their own legacy code and choice of RTOS with FSP, thus providing full flexibility in application development.\nThe Renesas solution also includes comprehensive development tools including integrated development environment, compilers, debug tools and programmers from Renesas as well as other ecosystem partners. Pin/function and TrustZone configurators ease development.\nThe Renesas RA4L1 Evaluation kit provides an efficient platform for application development by exposing all the functionality of the device on one platform and allowing debug capability for code development.
