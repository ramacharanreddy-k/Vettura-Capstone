Section 1.5 says: \n\"Connect this pin to the VSS pin by the smoothing capacitor used to stabilize the internal power supply\", you might think that you connect VCL to Vss right next to the main decoupling capacitor. This would be incorrect.\nThe Hardware User Manual, section 45 shows more clearly what to do- connect VCL to a capacitor that then connects to VSS- as seen in the right side of the below diagram."
