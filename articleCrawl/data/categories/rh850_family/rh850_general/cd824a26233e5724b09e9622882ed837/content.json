See Figure 1 to understand the options available.\nFigure 1: List of security settings data\n\n\nIn the above Settings list, 'Serial Programming Disable' and the 'Block Erase Disable' cannot be reversed. The other settings, like 'Read Disable' can be reversed via the serial programming interface. There is a dedicated command called configuration clear which allows this. This command will be executed by the RFP if the 'Erase Chip' option is selected. The two mentioned protection cannot be removed, as the configuration clear requires the serial programming interface and a successful erase to be executable.\nSuitable Products\nRH850"
